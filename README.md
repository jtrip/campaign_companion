# Campaign Companion

The idea behind this project is to create a web app that will make it fun and easy for players to contribute notes, images, and other things about a campaign they are playing together to help minimize the collective duplicated note taking and make it easier to find all the valuable info they might need.


## Tech Stack

Python, Flask, SQLite (or postgres if needed), HTMX, Bootstrap 5


## Notes

### Currently Considering
* The relationships between users, campaigns, characters, and storytellers.
* Roles to help players split information gathering in a natural way.
* Simple theming for different campaign settings vs basic light and dark mode support.

### Roadmap

* This might take a little while to get off the ground due to my time constraints.
